# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :
During my internship at CODTECH, I created a Chrome Extension named Website Tracker. The primary goal of this extension is to educate users about how they utilize their time on the internet and enhance their productivity as a whole.

The extension runs in the background and monitors the amount of time spent on various sites during the course of the day. It automatically categorizes these sites as productive (such as coding sites, learning sites, etc.) or unproductive (such as social media sites, entertainment sites, etc.). This categorization enables users to immediately identify which sites are keeping them productive and which are distractions.

To securely store and manage user data, I constructed a lightweight backend system. All of the browsing activity and time logs are saved securely and utilized to create comprehensive productivity reports. These reports are then displayed on a minimalistic and user-friendly dashboard that I also created as part of the project.

The dashboard provides insights like the total time spent on productive vs. unproductive websites, daily trends, and weekly summaries. This helps users understand their habits and make better decisions to stay on track with their goals.

Building this extension provided me with first-hand experience in Chrome Extension development, interacting with background scripts, content scripts, and storing data in the browser. I also learned to integrate the extension with a backend service and represent data in a useful manner.

Overall, Website Tracker is an easy yet effective tool that encourages thoughtful browsing and improved time management. I had a good time creating it and observing how small pieces of information can have large effects on everyday productivity.
